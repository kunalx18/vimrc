" Kunal Bharathi - Vim Config
" Saturday, March 16 2019
" Thanks to Maxin Cardamom https://github.com/changemewtf


" Basic Setup:

" Drop vi compatability
set nocompatible
filetype off                  " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
" alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
"call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plugin 'itchyny/lightline.vim'
Plugin 'terryma/vim-multiple-cursors'
Plugin 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plugin 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plugin 'w0rp/ale'
Plugin 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plugin 'tpope/vim-commentary'
Plugin 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Plugin 'valloric/youcompleteme'

" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required
" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
"filetype plugin on
"
" Brief help
" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate
" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal
"
" see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
" Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line
" enable syntax and plugins (for netrw)
syntax enable
" fzf path:
set rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf
" Powerline Fonts:
set rtp+=/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/vim
set laststatus=2
set t_Co=256

" Default backspace behaviour:
set backspace=indent,eol,start
" Finding Files:

" Recursive file search
set path+=**
" Display all matches on tab complete
set wildmenu

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Hit tab to :find by partial match
" - Use * to make it fuzzy

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - :b lets you autocomplete any open buffer


" TAG JUMPING:

" Create the `tags` file (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
" - Use g^] for ambiguous tags
" - Use ^t to jump back up the tag stack

" THINGS TO CONSIDER:
" - This doesn't help if you want a visual list of tags

" AUTOCOMPLETE:

" The good stuff is documented in |ins-completion|

" HIGHLIGHTS:
" - ^x^n for JUST this file
" - ^x^f for filenames (works with our path trick!)
" - ^x^] for tags only
" - ^n for anything specified by the 'complete' option

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth in the suggestion list

" FILE BROWSING:

" Tweaks for browsing
let g:netrw_banner=0        " disable annoying banner
let g:netrw_browse_split=4  " open in prior window
let g:netrw_altv=1          " open splits to the right
let g:netrw_liststyle=3     " tree view
let g:netrw_list_hide=netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.=',\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'

" NOW WE CAN:
" - :edit a folder to open a file browser
" - <CR>/v/t to open in an h-split/v-split/tab
" - check |netrw-browse-maps| for more mappings

" Remap nerdtree:
nnoremap `` :NERDTree<CR>

" SNIPPETS:

" Read an empty HTML template and move cursor to title
" nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/.skeleton.html<CR>3jwf>a

" NOW WE CAN:
" - Take over the world!
"   (with much fewer keystrokes)
